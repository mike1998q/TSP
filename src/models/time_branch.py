"""Time-domain branch: decomposition, linear backbone, and a sequence encoder.

The branch decomposes the input into a slow-moving trend and a seasonal
residual (a la Autoformer/DLinear) and forecasts with two cooperating paths,
both inside the branch:

1. a *linear backbone* — per-component linear maps from the look-back window
   straight to the horizon (the DLinear recipe, near-SOTA on ETT-style data);
2. a **Mamba** (selective state-space) encoder over the time axis whose
   zero-initialized head adds nonlinear corrections for long-range dynamics.

Operating directly on the raw samples lets this branch capture local,
non-periodic and trend structure that the frequency branch (which sees global
spectral content) tends to smooth out.

The encoder is selectable via ``encoder={mamba, mlp}``; Mamba is the default.
Processing is channel-independent: every variable is encoded with shared
weights. The branch returns both its forecast and a per-channel feature used
by the fusion gate.
